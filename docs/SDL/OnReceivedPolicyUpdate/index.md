## OnReceivedPolicyUpdate

Type
: Notification

Sender
: HMI

Purpose
: Trigger SDL to merge the Updated Policy Table to the Local Policy Table

### Notification

!!! MUST   
  - Send _SDL.OnReceivedPolicyUpdate_ notification to SDL after HMI finalized processing the updated Policy Table delivered via _BC.SystemRequest_ (for example, after decrypting it _in case_ and by the scheme required by Policies Server).
  - Decrypt the PTU file received via SystemRequest.
  - Notify SDL on successful decryption and provide the path to decrypted PTU file.
!!!

!!! NOTE
1. _SDL.OnReceivedPolicyUpdate_ dependencies:  
   - SDL expects _SDL.OnReceivedPolicyUpdate_ _only in case_ it's built with `"-DEXTENDED_POLICY: PROPRIETARY" flag or without this flag` and `-DEXTENDED_POLICY: EXTERNAL_PROPRIETARY` flag. _Otherwise_ SDL handles the entire PTU flow by itself.
   - SDL will not use Updated PT until notified by HMI.   
   
2. After getting _OnReceivedPolicyUpdate (policyFile)_ from HMI, _SDL must_ stop timeout started by _OnSystemRequest_ and validate the Policy Table Update (policyFile) of optional, required, or omitted:   
    - validation must reject Policy Table updates if it include fields with a status of ‘omitted.’
    - validation must reject Policy Table update if it does not include fields with a status of ‘required’.   
3. In case section with required status "optional/omitted" is omitted in Updated PT, and field of this section is marked as required, the validation of the mentioned field is not "required" (i.e. policy table must be considered as valid).
