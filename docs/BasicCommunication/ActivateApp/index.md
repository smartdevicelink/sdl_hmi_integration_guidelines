## ActivateApp

Type
: Function

Sender
: SDL

Purpose
: Request HMI to bring a specific app to the front (aka HMI level FULL)

!!! note

The activated application is assumed to receive access to the head unit's display, audio and control system which are:
  * Supported by the head unit and
  * Confirmed to be supported via responses to `IsReady` requests sent by SDL for the corresponding component

In the case of a successful HMILevel resumption, SDL will first assign a 'default_hmi' level from policies with a 3 second timeout, before resuming the application to either FULL or LIMITED.

If the HMI receives `ActivateApp` it can be assumed that the HMI has also already been provided with detailed information about the application through the [OnAppRegistered](../OnAppRegistered) RPC

!!!

!!! may

This request may be sent:
  * After SDL restores the application's state saved during a previous ignition off

!!!

### Behavior

If `level` is `FULL` or `LIMITED`: 

!!! must

  1. Activate the application on the HMI
  * Display [UI.Show](../../UI/Show) related parameters associated with the named `appID` in the case they were previously requested within ignition cycle
  * Display the corresponding template in the case one was previously requested by [UI.Show](../../UI/Show) for that application
  * Apply [UI.SetGlobalProperties](../../UI/SetGlobalProperties) associated with the named `appID`, if any
  * Apply [UI.AddSubMenu](../../UI/AddSubMenu) associated with the named `appID`, if any
  * Display the web page view in the main window of the application, in case the application `AppHMIType` is `WEB_VIEW` and a template has not yet been set.
  2. Make <abbr title="Voice Recognition">VR</abbr> commands accessible from previous [VR.AddCommand](../VR/AddCommand) for the named `appID` during the same ignition cycle
  3. Apply [TTS.SetGlobalProperties](../../TTS/SetGlobalProperties) associated with the `appID` in case previously requested since application registration
  4. Assign priority based on the `priority` parameter received. If the parameter is omitted, the HMI must assign a priority of `NONE` by default
  5. Respond with `SUCCESS` result code after the previous requirements have been met
  6. Set up the application as the active audio source if it is a media or navigation type application
