## OnSystemCapabilityUpdated

Type
: Notification

Sender
: SDL or HMI

Purpose
: Inform that a specific system capability has changed

### Notification

1. HMI sends OnSystemCapabilityUpdated notification to SDL after creating a widget _(see also [CreateWindow](../../UI/CreateWindow/index.md))_.
2. HMI sends OnSystemCapabilityUpdated notification after receiving UI.Show(templateConfiguration) request manipulating the content presented of main window or widgets.
3. HMI should not send `WEB_VIEW` template in `WindowCapability` for any widgets, and applications with `AppHMIType` other than `WEB_VIEW`.
4. If the application changes template to `WEB_VIEW`, HMI should send OnSystemCapabilityUpdated with the following `textFields` restrictions in `WindowCapability`:
    * `menuName` and `templateTitle` should be included, if they are visible on HMI.
    * `mainField1-4`, `statusBar` and `mediaTrack` should not be included if OEM implemented the `WEB_VIEW` template without these text fields.
    * `availabletemplates`, `buttonCapabilities` and `imageTypeSupported` should reflect the general capabilities of the window/system.
5. HMI sends OnSystemCapabilityUpdated(VIDEO_STREAMING) notification to notify a subscribed mobile application that video streaming resolution has switched.

!!! NOTE

Template `WEB_VIEW` is only allowed for the WebEngine applications with `AppHMIType`=`WEB_VIEW`.

#### Recommendations for how various screen modes have to be handled

If the change is a Picture-in-Picture-type change, scale the current video stream to the size you desire without going through this flow. Touches should never be passed to the app. Either a system menu/buttons should be displayed when selected, or the selection should bring the user immediately back to the full-screen app.

If the change is a split-screen type change (and cannot be handled by scaling the original video), then go through this flow. If the app does not support your custom split-resolution, either don't allow the user to put the app in split screen, or scale the video stream to a size that fits the window and use "black bars" to fill the rest of the window. Touches may be passed to the app in certain limited cases.

 * The window must have a width of at least 3" and a height of at least 3".

 * The touches must be offset for the developer so that 0,0 continues to be in the top-left corner of the app window. If these requirements are not met, either a system menu / buttons should be displayed when selected, or the selection should bring the user immediately back to the full-screen app.
