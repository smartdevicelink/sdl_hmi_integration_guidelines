SDL sends this notification when:

  3. A HeartBeat timeout occurs between the mobile device and SDL Core (if a HeartBeat timeout is set).

!!! MUST

  1. HMI must distinguish distinguish between an unexpected disconnect and a regular exit from the `unexpectedDisconnect` parameter.
  2. HMI must removed the named application from the list of registered applications.

!!!

!!! MAY

  1. In case of an `Unexpected Disconnect`, the HMI may display a popup of some kind that reports a connection with the named app was unexpectedly lost.
  2. In case of any type of disconnect, the HMI may switch to a `Home` screen that displays a list of other registered applications.
  3. The HMI may delete all application data after an app disconnects, except for `VRGrammars`.

!!!

Information about the application (name, appID, etc) is provided by SDL via [BC.UpdateAppList](../updateapplist) or [BC.OnAppRegistered](../onappregistered).
