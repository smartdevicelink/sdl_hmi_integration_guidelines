## SetMediaClockTimer

Type
: Function

Sender
: SDL

Purpose
: Set a value and update mode for the media clock of a media application.

The UI.SetMediaClock timer request indicates either an initial value for the media clock timer for a media application or an update to this value. The request may come for the application which is not currently active on the HMI.

### Request

!!! MUST
1. Perform the update type indicated by the `updateMode` parameter:   
    * If the application is not active, the HMI must still store the values to be calculated for later display on the HMI.   
    * If the application is active, the updates must begin immediately.   
2. Exhibit the following behavior based on the `updateMode` parameter:
    * COUNTUP/COUNTDOWN modes:   
        * Start counting up or down from the requested `startTime` value at the specified `countRate` with a step of 1 second;
        * Continue counting up or down until:
            * The next request of _SetMediaClockTimer_ with appropriate parameters comes;
            * Zero is reached in the case of COUNTDOWN.   
    * PAUSE mode:   
        * Pause the timer that is counting up or down;   
        * If `startTime` or `endTime` parameters are provided, the values must be updated on the HMI.   
    * CLEAR mode:    
        * Clear `startTime` to 00:00:00 in the case that the `startTime` parameter is not provided in the request, otherwise, `startTime` must be updated with a new value. It is up to HMI to determine the way the media clock timer is cleared: either to remove it from display or to set it to zero.   
3. Respond with the result code (see _response_ section) correspondingly to the results of this RPC execution.
!!!
    
!!! NOTE
1. SDL will not send this request if the `mediaClock` field is not indicated as supported in [UI.GetCapabilities](../getcapabilities).   
2. HMI must remember the mode and the value (continuing to update it in case of COUNTUP / COUNTDOWN) of the media clock timer associated with appID and display the accurate values whenever the appID application is activated after having been deactivated.   
3. Initially, the appID together with other application-related information is provided by SDL within one of _UpdateAppList_ and _OnAppRegistered_ RPCs.

#### Parameters

|Name|Type|Mandatory|Additional|Description|
|:---|:---|:--------|:---------|:----------|
|startTime|[Common.TimeFormat](../../common/structs/#timeformat)|false||_startTime_ must be provided together with modes: "COUNTUP", "COUNTDOWN", "PAUSE" to HMI. _startTime_ will be ignored for "RESUME", and "CLEAR".|
|endTime|[Common.TimeFormat](../../common/structs/#timeformat)|false||endTime can be provided together with modes: "COUNTUP", "COUNTDOWN", "PAUSE" to HMI. To be used to calculate any visual progress bar (if not provided, this feature is ignored). If endTime is greater then startTime for COUNTDOWN or less than startTime for COUNTUP, then the request will return an INVALID_DATA. _endTime_ will be ignored for "PAUSE", "RESUME", and "CLEAR".|
|updateMode|[Common.ClockUpdateMode](../../common/enums/#clockupdatemode)|true||Enumeration to control the media clock. In case of pause, resume, or clear, the start time value is ignored and shall be left out. For resume, the time continues with the same value as it was when paused.|
|audioStreamingIndicator|[Common.AudioStreamingIndicator](../../common/enums/#audiostreamingindicator)|false||Indicates that a button press of the Play/Pause button would play, pause or stop the current playback.|
|forwardSeekIndicator|[Common.SeekStreamingIndicator](../../common/structs/#seekstreamingindicator)|false||Used to control the forward seek button to either skip forward a set amount of time or to the next track.|
|backSeekIndicator|[Common.SeekStreamingIndicator](../../common/structs/#seekstreamingindicator)|false||Used to control the backward seek button to either skip back a set amount of time or to the prevoius track.|
|countRate|Float|false|minvalue: 0.1<br>maxvalue: 100.0<br>defvalue: 1.0|The rate at which the media clock timer will progress. Values less than 1.0 will advance the timer slower than real-time (ex. 0.5 would advance the timer at 50% speed), while values greater than 1.0 will advance the timer faster than real-time (ex. 2.0 would advance the timer at 200% speed).|
|appID|Integer|true|||
